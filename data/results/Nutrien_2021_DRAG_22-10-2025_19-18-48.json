Original explanation: The company acknowledges stakeholder concerns related to the use of chemicals in agriculture and identifies \"Soil health\" and \"Environmental impacts of products\" as material topics. However, there is no disclosure that the company considers financial risks specifically related to reduced soil fertility caused by its pesticides. In fact, the company often highlights how its products and practices support and improve soil health, or focuses on managing other environmental impacts of chemicals (e.g., impacts on pollinators, runoff). The specific financial risk regarding reduced soil fertility caused by its own pesticides is not mentioned.",
