A key strategy involves managing less productive farmland alongside fields and waterways to provide corridors connecting wildlife habitats. These multifunctional field margins support sustainable intensification on more productive land and help reintroduce local species while providing buffers for soil and water. Through our Operation Pollinator program, we have been helping farmers promote pollinating insects on commercial farms for over 15 years. The program uses specially selected wildflowers to attract pollinators and increase biodiversity."
