            "text": "In 2023, $10 million of environmental provisions were released due to updated estimates of costs for remediation activity (2022: costs recognized of $4 million). In 2023, a further $10 million of environmental provisions were recognized in relation to a third party contractor’s facility experiencing extensive operational and regulatory issues where regulators have required companies who used the facility to share the costs of remedial action (2022: $10 million). Syngenta has a 16% percent share of these costs. Otherwise, in 2023 and 2022, except for $13 million (2022: $21 million) of cash outflows reflecting remediation activity, there were no significant changes to environmental provisions. Proposals have been made suggesting remediation of the existing contamination on certain shared sites in preference to monitoring and containment. Syngenta will negotiate the proposals with the relevant authorities but the final adopted solution is subject to regulatory uncertainty and the ultimate liability may be higher or lower than the amount provided. Taken together, the provisions at December 31, 2023, for these shared sites comprise approximately 26 percent of total environmental provisions. The top ten exposures at the end of 2023 comprise approximately 85 percent of the total environmental provisions. In the opinion of management, reasonably possible increases in the provisions related to these top 10 exposures would not exceed 122 percent of the total environmental provision recognized at December 31, 2023."
