This initiative affects the Conda Phosphate plant previously owned by Nu-West Industries, Inc. (\\\"Nu-West\\\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (\\\"NOVs\\\") for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will be not material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations."

Risk-free discount rates range from 3.1 percent to 5.5 percent. 3 Total undiscounted cash flows are $4.0 billion. For the Potash segment, this represents total undiscounted cash flows in the first year of decommissioning. This excludes tailings dissolution, fine tails capping, tailings management area reclamation, post-reclamation activities and monitoring, and final decommissioning beyond the first year of decommissioning, which are estimated to take an additional 120 to 480 years. 4 For nitrogen sites, there are no significant asset retirement obligations recorded. We considered the historical performance of our facilities as well as our planned maintenance, major upgrades and replacements, which can extend the useful lives beyond the foreseeable future. 5 Includes certain potash and phosphate sites that are non-operating sites, with the majority of phosphate site payments taking place over the next 10 years."

Anticipated costs associated with these matters are added to accrued environmental costs in the manner described in Note 22. We have established provisions for environmental site assessment and/or remediation matters to the extent that we consider expenses associated with those matters likely to be incurred. Except for the uncertainties described below, we do not believe that our future obligations with respect to these matters are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Legal matters with significant uncertainties include the following: - The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“US EPA”) has an ongoing enforcement initiative directed at the phosphate industry related to the scope of an exemption for mineral processing wastes under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). This initiative affects the Conda Phosphate plant previously owned by Nu-West Industries, Inc. (“Nu-West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nutrien (Canada) Holdings ULC, and the Nutrien phosphoric acid facilities in Aurora, North Carolina; Geismar, Louisiana; and White Springs, Florida. Nutrien facilities received US EPA notices of violation (“NOVs”) for alleged violations of the RCRA and various other environmental laws. Notwithstanding the sale of the Conda Phosphate operations in January 2018, Nu-West remains responsible for certain environmental liabilities attributable to its historic activities and for resolution of the NOVs. The facilities have been and continue to be involved in ongoing discussions with the US EPA, the US Department of Justice and the related state agencies to resolve these matters, with one such settlement being reached for the Geismar facility. The Geismar consent decree was entered on October 19, 2022, and resolved the allegations associated with the historic phosphoric acid operations at that facility. Due to the nature of the allegations at the other facilities, we are uncertain as to how the matters will be resolved. Based on settlements with other members of the phosphate industry and the Geismar consent decree, we expect that a In millions of dollars, except as otherwise noted Nutrien Annual Report 2024 | 117 ## Page 39 of 46 N Overview MD&A Five-year highlights Financial statements and notes Notes resolution could involve any or all of the following: 1) penalties, which we currently believe will be not material; 2) modification of certain operating practices; 3) capital improvement projects; 4) providing financial assurance for the future closure, maintenance and monitoring costs for the phosphogypsum stack system; and 5) addressing findings resulting from the RCRA section 3013 site investigations."
