            "text": "At December 31, 2020, Syngenta reported in Note 19 provisions for environmental remediation of $179 million (2019: $180 million), some of which are included within restructuring provisions. Remediation of environmental damage at sites with which Syngenta is associated typically takes a long time to complete due to the substantial amount of planning and regulatory approvals normally required before remediation activities can begin. The assumptions used by Syngenta to estimate its environmental provisions may change significantly before or during the remediation period due to changes in the extent of remediation required or the method used to remediate the damage. In addition, increases in or releases of environmental provisions may be necessary whenever new developments occur or additional information becomes available. The major uncertainties that impact the outcome of remediation are: * the extent of the contaminated land area, which is not always limited to land occupied by the Syngenta site. Ongoing monitoring or   remediation work may identify changes in the area believed to be contaminated; * the nature of the work Syngenta will be obliged to perform or pay for. This depends upon the current or proposed use of contaminated   land, substantively enacted legislation, and land zoning by and negotiation with the relevant regulatory authorities. In Switzerland,   proposed remediation plans at certain sites may be subject to public referenda; * sharing of costs with other past and present occupiers of Syngenta’s sites. At certain shared sites, Syngenta is responsible for an   agreed proportion of remediation costs, which may change following discussions with authorities and the affected third parties. At other   sites, third parties have agreed to reimburse Syngenta for some or all of the costs it incurs. Consequently, environmental provisions can change significantly. Because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating such long-term future obligations, Syngenta periodically supplements its internal expertise with external expertise when determining environmental provisions. In 2020, $9 million of environmental provisions were recognized due to updated estimates of costs for remediation activity. In 2019, $13 million of environmental provisions were recognized related to remediation triggered by the announced closure of a US manufacturing site. In 2020, $5 million (2019: $8 million) of provisions were released due to regulatory and other indications that remediation requirements at various sites were substantially complete. Otherwise, in 2020 and 2019, except for $14 million (2019: $9 million) of cash outflows reflecting remediation activity, there were no significant changes to environmental provisions. 28 ## Page 32 of 104 Notes to the Syngenta AG Group Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Report 2020 Proposals have been made suggesting remediation of the existing contamination on certain shared sites in preference to monitoring and containment. Syngenta will negotiate the proposals with the relevant authorities but the final adopted solution is subject to regulatory uncertainty and the ultimate liability may be higher or lower than the amount provided. Taken together, the provisions at December 31, 2020, for these shared sites comprise approximately 26 percent of total environmental provisions. The top ten exposures at the end of 2020 comprise approximately 80 percent of the total environmental provisions. In the opinion of management, reasonably possible increases in the provisions related to these top 10 exposures would not exceed 92 percent of the total environmental provision recognized at December 31, 2020. At Syngenta’s Monthey, Switzerland, production site, the majority of the work currently needed to remediate groundwater and soil contamination at the site has been carried out. During 2019, assessments indicated additional costs and a longer timeframe to complete"

            "text": "In 2020, three significant unplanned releases took place compared to one in 2019. Two events with similar characteristics occurred at one of our sites in the UK, where short-term elevated concentrations of active ingredient and a non-hazardous intermediate were identified in groundwater. These were very small volume releases and were reported to the regulator. Significant resources have already been invested in operational improvements and drainage repairs. Further, major infrastructure improvements are proposed for the coming years. The third event also occurred at a UK site, where a broken drain from a process vessel was identified. Monitoring and remediation activities are on-going in agreement with the regulator, and a further new program of inspection and remediation has been initiated.

To a lesser extent so does the production of seeds. At Syngenta, we are committed to maximizing the efficient use of resources while reducing waste and minimizing the impact on the environment. Materiality matrix classification: → Monitored (Resource efficiency) Frameworks: GRI: - UNGC: 8 SDG: 12 45 ## Page 46 of 96 Syngenta ESG Report 2020 Back to Contents **Management approach** As stated in our [HSE Policy and Standards](https://www.syngenta.com/company/policies-and-standards/health-safety-and-environment), we actively promote environmental protection, including waste management. Through our tailored HSE management system, we monitor and improve performance on our sites. More information can be found in the [FAQ: Environmental policy and management](https://www.syngenta.com/company/sustainability/faq-sustainability/environmental-policy-and-management) section of our website. We aim to reduce the waste intensity of our operations and supply chain by 20% by 2030 compared to our 2016 baseline. All Syngenta sites must ensure that waste is managed appropriately from generation until final treatment or disposal. To reduce our waste footprint, we focus our efforts on improving process efficiency. This is particularly important when introducing new products and designing the manufacturing processes at the product development stage, before large-scale production starts. We also seek opportunities to significantly reduce the volume of packaging waste, with a focus on reducing plastics and increasing collection schemes. Through our Supplier Sustainability Program, we assess our chemical suppliers on their environmental performance, which includes reviewing waste management practices. (See [Working with suppliers](https://www.syngenta.com/company/sustainability/partnerships-and-dialogues/working-with-suppliers)) **Key performance indicators** In our own operations, we report annually on hazardous and non- hazardous waste generation. This year, we introduced new performance indicators to measure waste generation in our supply chain in alignment with our waste intensity reduction target, which covers both our own operations and the supply chain. The performance of our sites is based on data collected through internal reporting processes, as defined in our SERAM user guide. The waste performance of our supply chain is estimated using a hybrid approach of spend-based and average data methods.

            "text": "Syngenta has recorded provisions for environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites throughout the world. These provisions are estimates of amounts payable or expected to become payable and take into consideration the number of other potentially responsible parties at each site and the identity and financial positions of such parties in light of the joint and several nature of certain of the liabilities. The material components of Syngenta’s environmental provisions are based on a risk assessment involving investigation of the various sites. It is reasonably possible that Syngenta may be required to make expenditures in excess of the established provisions to remediate environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third party sites throughout the world. Further, in cases where it is not possible to estimate reliably the remediation costs that may be incurred in the future for environmental damage that has occurred at sites currently in operation and having no present obligation for environmental damage remediation, no provisions have been made. This is because it is neither possible to determine a time limit beyond which the sites will no longer be operated, nor what remediation costs may be required upon their eventual closure. In the USA, Syngenta and/or its indemnitors or indemnitees, have been named under federal legislation (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended) as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) in respect of several sites. Syngenta expects to be indemnified against a proportion of the liabilities associated with a number of these sites by the sellers of the businesses associated with such sites and, where appropriate, actively participates in or monitors the clean-up activities at the sites in respect of which it is a PRP. Provisions for legal and product liability settlements, all of which are individually immaterial, relate to various legal proceedings incidental to the normal conduct of Syngenta’s business, including proceedings involving product liability claims, commercial claims, employment and wrongful termination claims, patent infringement claims, competition law claims, indirect tax assessment claims, regulatory compliance claims, waste disposal claims and tort claims relating to the release of chemicals into the environment. Other provisions mainly comprise provisions for long-term contractual obligations under license and other agreements. ## Page 54 of 104 Notes to the Syngenta AG Group Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Report 2020 51 Movements in provisions for the year ended December 31, 2020 are as follows: ($m) | January 1 | Charged to income | Release of provisions credited to income | Payments | Actuarial losses | Transfers offset in defined benefit pension assets | Currency translation effects/ other | December 31 --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- **Restructuring provisions:** | | | | | | | | Employee termination costs | 29 | 47 | (8) | (45) | ‐ | ‐ | 5 | 28 Other third party costs | 74 | 7 | (1) | (10) | ‐ | (2) | (5) | 63 **Employee benefits:** | | | | | | | | Pensions | 451 | 108 | (13) | (174) | 103 | - | 63 | 538 Other post-retirement benefits | 19 | 1 | (2) | ‐ | 1 | 2 | - | 21 Other long-term employee benefits | 61 | 13 | (4) | (3) | ‐ | - | (4) | 63 Environmental provisions | 164 | 9 | (5) | (8) | ‐ | - | 11 | 171 Provisions for legal and product liability settlements | 92 | 15 | (19) | (6) | ‐ | - | 10 | 92 Other provisions | 85 | 13 | (11) | 1 | ‐ | - | 2 | 90 **Total** | **975** | **213** | **(63)** | **(245)** | **104** | **‐** | **82** | **1,066** Within restructuring provisions, employee termination costs include severance, pension and other costs directly related to affected employees and other third party costs principally include payments for early termination of contracts with third parties related to redundant activities.
