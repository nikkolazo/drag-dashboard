The price was determined considering the analysis of emission reduction alternatives through a marginal abatement curve where the cost per unit abated for our operations was determined to be close to US$10-15/ ton. In addition, this also considered the current green tax system (SIV in Spanish) and its future change of criteria from a technological one -boilers and turbines- to an emissions one, with a cut-off threshold of 25 kCO2e. Other international regulations have also been integrated into the price, such as the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which will tax the importation of various goods produced outside the European Union, including fertilizers. This involves analyzing the potential affected emissions projected for each SQM operation plus the company’s sustainability objectives. **How is it used?** The internal price on emissions is used as a criterion in the evaluation of the different types of projects to be executed in the calendar year, in order to promote and strengthen alternatives that are more sustainable, i.e., that have a lower impact on emissions, and that eventually are more costly without the inclusion of this internal tax."

Other international regulations have also been integrated into the price, such as the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which will tax the importation of various goods produced outside the European Union, including fertilizers. **How is it used?** The internal price on emissions is used as a criterion in the evaluation of the different types of projects to be executed in the calendar year, in order to promote and strengthen alternatives that are more sustainable, i.e., that have a lower impact on emissions, and that eventually are more costly without the inclusion of this internal tax."

They also broadly discuss reputational risks and operational risks from being perceived negatively by investors and communities, which could encompass concerns about their agricultural practices. However, they do not provide specific financial valuations or estimates related to these perceptions for their agriculture-related products.",
